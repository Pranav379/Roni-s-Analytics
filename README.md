# Roni's Analytics
This project, developed for the TAMU Datathon hosted from 11/9/2024 to 11/10/2024, contains the code that earned 1st place for the Roni's Challenge at the 2024 TAMU Datathon.

## Overview
Roni's Analytics is an analytical user-friendly and business-facing dashboard that provides useful insights into restaurant sales, consumer preferences, and key trends. This dashboard includes insightful visualizations, graphs from Google Trends, and even an interactive chatbot.

## Software Used
We used several Python libraries to write our code and Streamlit for a dashboard visualization.

## Installation and Usage
